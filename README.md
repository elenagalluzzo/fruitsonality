# fruitsonality
Fruitsonality is my first completed iOS app project. The user is given a scenario with multiple prompts in which they can choose how to react to the scenario by clicking their choice. Depending on their choices, they are presented a fruit at the end of the quiz of their fruit personality. Fruitsonality was loosely based on the take home project Destini from Dr. Angela Yuâ€™s [The Complete iOS App Development Bootcamp](https://www.udemy.com/course/ios-13-app-development-bootcamp/).

Fruitsonality was built with Xcode and written entirely in Swift 5X. The design was created using Storyboard and Auto Layout.
